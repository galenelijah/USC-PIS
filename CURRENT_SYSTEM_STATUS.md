## üèÅ **Final Assessment**

**USC-PIS represents a technically sophisticated healthcare management system with excellent infrastructure and comprehensive record management capabilities.** The recent completion of backup, email, and media storage systems demonstrates professional-grade implementation.

**The primary challenge is not technical quality but the absence of core healthcare workflow systems** - particularly appointment scheduling - that are essential for daily clinic operations.

**Grade Distribution**:
- **Infrastructure & Security**: B (Good but Administrative Access Broken)
- **Record Management**: B+ (Functional, Migration Pending)  
- **Healthcare Workflows**: D (Critical Gaps)
- **Administrative Interfaces**: F (Completely Broken)
- **Overall System**: C- (Critical Repairs Required)

**Recommendation**: **EMERGENCY FIXES REQUIRED** - Restore administrative functionality before any new development. The system's core administrative capabilities are completely compromised.

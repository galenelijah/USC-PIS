## üö® **CRITICAL: Immediate Security Fixes Required**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 1: Security Vulnerabilities (72 Hours)**
**URGENT - Production Risk - Must Fix Before Continued Use**

#### **Critical Security Issues Identified:**

1. **Hardcoded Secret Key** (`settings.py`)
   - **Risk**: Complete system compromise possible
   - **Impact**: Anyone with repository access can decrypt all data
   - **Fix**: Remove hardcoded fallback, require environment variable
   ```python
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
   if not SECRET_KEY:
       raise ValueError("SECRET_KEY environment variable is required")
   ```

2. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** (`authentication/views.py`)
   - **Risk**: Database compromise and data theft
   - **Impact**: Attackers could access all patient data
   - **Fix**: Replace raw SQL with Django ORM or parameterized queries

3. **Production Credentials in Repository**
   - **Risk**: Database access exposure in version control
   - **Impact**: External access to production database
   - **Fix**: Remove from git history, implement secure secret management

4. **Missing CSRF Protection** (Some API endpoints)
   - **Risk**: Cross-site request forgery attacks
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized actions on behalf of users
   - **Fix**: Ensure all state-changing endpoints have CSRF protection

#### **Security Fix Implementation Plan**
- **Timeline**: 72 hours maximum
- **Resources**: 1 senior developer, 16-24 hours
- **Budget**: $2,000-3,000
- **Testing**: Comprehensive security audit after fixes

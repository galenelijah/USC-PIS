## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Warning**

**The current system, while functional, is missing fundamental healthcare management capabilities that could limit its real-world adoption. The appointment scheduling gap is particularly severe - most healthcare operations cannot function without this core feature.**

**Recommendation**: Treat appointment system implementation as **CRITICAL PRIORITY** and begin immediately, as this affects the entire operational workflow of any healthcare facility.

---

**Bottom Line**: USC-PIS has excellent technical foundations but needs immediate attention to critical healthcare workflow gaps. With focused development over the next 3-4 months, it can become a comprehensive, market-competitive healthcare management system.

**Next Steps**: Begin appointment system development while establishing testing and backup infrastructure in parallel.

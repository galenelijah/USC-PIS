# Health Records: Medical-Only UI and Removal of “Record Type”

- Date: 2025-09-06
- Area: Frontend (React, Vite)
- File changed: `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/HealthRecords.jsx`

## Summary

The `/health-records` page is now strictly for medical records. The UI no longer surfaces or relies on the “Record Type” field. All dental-specific UI, stats, and exports were removed from this page to reduce confusion and align with the route’s intent.

## Key Changes

- Remove Record Type from create/edit dialogs.
  - Creation retains an internal default of `MEDICAL`.
  - Templates set `record_type` to `MEDICAL` automatically.
- Remove dental templates; keep medical templates only.
- Table cleanup:
  - Remove “Type” column and chip.
  - “View” button always available (no type conditional).
- Quick stats: remove the Dental Records card.
- Quick actions: remove “Manage Dental Records”.
- Exports (CSV/Excel):
  - Drop “Record Type” column and all dental-only fields.
  - Export medical fields only (complaint, history, vitals, labs, meds, follow-up, notes).
- Print/report view:
  - Update titles to “Medical Records Report”.
  - Remove dental counters/sections and any “Type” decoration.

## Rationale

- `/health-records` is intended to manage medical records; having a “Record Type” control created ambiguity and led to mixed medical/dental UI.
- The API already targets medical records via `/api/patients/medical-records/`.

## Implementation Notes

- Defaulting behavior: new records default to `MEDICAL`; this keeps payloads consistent with backend expectations.
- No backend changes required; endpoints and serializers remain the same.
- Student view (`StudentHealthRecords.jsx`) still shows “Record Type” for the student-specific page and was not changed as part of this task.

## How to Verify

1. Navigate to `/health-records` (staff/clinician account).
2. Click “New Clinical Record”: ensure Record Type is not shown; save succeeds.
3. Use “Use Template”: templates are medical-only; saved records appear as medical.
4. Table: no Type column/chip; “View” opens the medical record modal.
5. Quick actions: “Manage Dental Records” is removed.
6. Exports (CSV/Excel): verify no Record Type or dental-only columns; medical fields included.
7. Print: header reads “Medical Records Report”; no dental sections.

## Potential Follow-ups (Optional)

- Mirror these removals in `StudentHealthRecords.jsx` if the student page should be medical-only as well.
- Review navigation labels to ensure clear separation between medical and dental routes.

## Follow-ups Implemented

- Student page medical-only alignment:
  - Updated `StudentHealthRecords.jsx` export to remove Record Type and dental-only columns; exports now include medical fields only.
  - Page already filtered to medical records and labeled as “My Medical Records”.
  - Quick link to Dental Records retained for navigation clarity.
- Navigation clarity:
  - Updated `Layout/Sidebar.jsx` labels and descriptions:
    - “Patient History (Medical & Dental)” with description “Browse patient medical and dental history (separate tabs)”.
    - “Medical Records” description: “Create and manage medical (clinic) records”.
    - “Dental Records” description: “Manage dental procedures and records”.

## User Prompts (This Session)

1. understand the codebase structure
   - Scanned repository tree and key backend/frontend files (`ls`, `rg`).
   - Reviewed `backend/backend/settings.py` and `urls.py` for API routes and SPA integration.
   - Mapped Django apps and the active Vite app at `backend/frontend/frontend`.

2. Remove Record Type when creating new clinical record on /health-records page
   - Updated `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/HealthRecords.jsx` to hide the Record Type selector in create mode only (kept for edit).
   - Ensured create defaults to `MEDICAL`; templates preserved their categories.

3. i think it should be gone completely, since /health-records is basically for medical records only
   - Removed Record Type UI entirely from create/edit dialogs.
   - Removed dental templates; kept medical templates only; forced template-created records to `MEDICAL`.
   - Removed Type column/chip from table; made "View" always available.
   - Removed dental quick stats card and “Manage Dental Records” quick action.
   - Updated exports (CSV/Excel) to exclude Record Type and all dental-only columns; kept medical fields only.
   - Updated print report to "Medical Records Report" and removed dental stats/sections and type labels.
   - Kept API usage as `/api/patients/medical-records/` (no backend changes required).

# Session Log — 2025-09-05

## Summary
- Implemented unobtrusive UX guidance across the app via a reusable InfoTooltip component and header help texts.
- Added field-level hints to key forms and standardized validation messages using shared Yup schemas.
- Updated documentation to reflect UX patterns, validation standards, and developer usage notes.

## Changes
- New: `components/utils/InfoTooltip.jsx` for inline help tooltips.
- Updated: `components/utils/PageHeader.jsx` to accept `helpText` and render an info tooltip next to the title.
- Added tooltips to major pages (Dashboard, Reports, Notifications, Database Monitor, Email Administration, Campaigns, Medical/Dental Records, Profile, Files, Auth screens).
- Forms: `MyTextField`, `MySelector`, `MyDatePicker`, `MyPassField` now support `hint` to show subtle guidance when there’s no error.
- Validation: Centralized via `utils/validationSchemas.js` commonValidation; added `phone()` and `idNumber()` helpers.
- Profile Setup: Schemas refactored to use commonValidation for consistent error messages.
- Registration: Added hints under fields and preserved standardized error messages.

## Rationale
- Improve first-time user success by surfacing concise, context-aware help.
- Reduce confusion and support quick task completion without cluttering the UI.
- Ensure validation messaging is consistent and predictable across all forms.

## Verification
- Hover info icons next to page titles to see quick guidance.
- Register and Profile Setup forms display hints under fields; try invalid input to see standardized errors.
- Confirm no layout shifts from tooltips/hints in common viewports.

## Next Actions
- Extend hints and consistent validation to Medical/Dental record creation dialogs and Medical Certificates form.
- Add role-specific tips where workflows differ (admin vs. student).
- Consider a “Help” drawer linking to the User Guide for deeper instructions.

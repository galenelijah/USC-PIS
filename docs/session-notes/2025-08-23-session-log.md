# Session Log â€” 2025-08-23

## Summary
- Created contributor guide (`AGENTS.md`) and issue tracker (`OPEN_ISSUES.md`).
- Implemented four UX fixes: registration error mapping, dropdowns for year level/school, patient search on `/patients`, and gender-aware BMI image on patient dashboard.
- Captured a full list of modified files in `SESSION_CHANGES.md`.

## Changes (high-level)
- Registration: Inline server-side validation errors mapped to fields.
- Profile Setup: `Year Level` and `School/Campus` now dropdowns.
- Patients: Added debounced search UI with API integration.
- Patient Dashboard: BMI image selection normalized by sex label.

See `SESSION_CHANGES.md` for file-by-file details.

## Issues Tracked
Logged in `OPEN_ISSUES.md`:
- Registration error messages
- Year Level and School/Campus dropdowns
- Student dashboard card routing
- Clinical record type selector
- Auto-refresh for `/health-records`
- Generate Certificate button visibility
- Search on `/patients` page
- Campaign view content
- Reports download errors
- Database/Backup monitor issues
- Medical dashboard image gender

## Decisions
- Keep campus choices as label-identical IDs to preserve readable values.
- Prefer inline error mapping for registration while retaining top-level alert for non-field errors.
- Patients search uses API (`/patients/patients/?search=`) with 300ms debounce.
- Normalize sex via `getSexLabel()` for BMI imagery to handle numeric/string inputs.

## Next Actions
- Extend dropdowns to Edit Profile (`src/components/EditProfile.jsx`).
- Add search to student records and optional deep-linking via URL params.
- Verify reports backend: ensure `/api/reports/generated/<id>/download/` returns blob with correct headers; confirm WeasyPrint/xhtml2pdf installed.
- Confirm utils endpoints return JSON with 200/401 (not HTML) to avoid Axios interceptor redirects.

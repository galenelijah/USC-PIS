# USC-PIS Comprehensive Security Audit Report
**Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Scope**: Django Backend Security Assessment  
**Status**: Critical and High-Priority Issues Identified  

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit of the USC-PIS Django backend reveals a **significantly improved security posture** compared to previous assessments, with many critical vulnerabilities previously identified having been resolved. However, several important security issues remain that require immediate attention.

### Overall Security Rating: **B+ (Good)**
- **Previous Rating**: D (Poor) - July 15, 2025
- **Improvement**: Substantial security enhancements implemented
- **Remaining Issues**: 1 Critical, 2 High, 4 Medium, 3 Low priority vulnerabilities

## üî¥ Critical Security Issues

### 1. **CSRF Exemption on Public API Test Endpoint**
**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/authentication/views.py:1020`  
**Issue**: `@csrf_exempt` decorator on `api_test` endpoint  
**Risk**: Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks  
**Impact**: HIGH - Allows unauthorized state-changing requests  

```python
@csrf_exempt
@require_http_methods(["GET"])
def api_test(request):
```

**Recommendation**: Remove `@csrf_exempt` decorator as this endpoint only accepts GET requests and doesn't need CSRF exemption.

## üü† High-Priority Security Issues

### 2. **Content Security Policy Too Permissive**
**Files**: 
- `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/backend/settings.py:307-308`
- `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/backend/middleware.py:78-79`

**Issue**: CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` for scripts  
**Risk**: XSS vulnerability despite CSP protection  
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Reduces effectiveness of CSP against XSS  

```python
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net")
```

**Recommendation**: Implement nonce-based CSP or move to strict CSP without unsafe directives.

### 3. **Information Disclosure in Error Messages**
**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/utils/views.py`  
**Issue**: System health endpoints return detailed error information  
**Risk**: Information disclosure to attackers  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Provides system architecture details  

**Recommendation**: Sanitize error messages in production, log detailed errors server-side only.

## üü° Medium-Priority Security Issues

### 4. **Debug User Creation Endpoint in Production**
**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/authentication/views.py:432-467`  
**Issue**: `debug_register` endpoint allows anyone to create test users  
**Risk**: Unauthorized user creation  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Could be used for system abuse  

**Recommendation**: Disable in production or add proper authentication/authorization.

### 5. **Weak Rate Limiting Implementation**
**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/backend/middleware.py:150-206`  
**Issue**: In-memory rate limiting without persistence  
**Risk**: Easy bypass through server restarts  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Rate limiting can be circumvented  

**Recommendation**: Implement Redis-based or database-backed rate limiting.

### 6. **Overly Permissive CORS in Development**
**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/backend/settings.py:134`  
**Issue**: `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True` in DEBUG mode  
**Risk**: Any website can make requests during development  
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM - Development environment vulnerability  

**Recommendation**: Use specific origins even in development.

### 7. **Weak Session Configuration**
**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/backend/settings.py:200-201`  
**Issue**: `SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST = True` causes unnecessary overhead  
**Risk**: Performance impact and potential DoS  
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM - Resource exhaustion  

**Recommendation**: Set to False and implement proper session management.

## üü¢ Low-Priority Issues

### 8. **Hardcoded Test Passwords in Code**
**Multiple Files**: Test files contain hardcoded passwords  
**Issue**: Test passwords visible in source code  
**Risk**: Information disclosure  
**Impact**: LOW - Test credentials only  

**Recommendation**: Use environment variables or random generation for test passwords.

### 9. **Verbose Logging in Production**
**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/backend/middleware.py:138`  
**Issue**: API request logging includes sensitive user information  
**Risk**: Information disclosure in logs  
**Impact**: LOW - Depends on log access controls  

**Recommendation**: Sanitize logged information in production.

### 10. **File Upload Size Limits**
**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/sgale/OneDrive/Documents/GitHubProjects/USC-PIS/USC-PIS/backend/file_uploads/validators.py:32-36`  
**Issue**: Large file size limits (50MB for documents)  
**Risk**: Resource exhaustion attacks  
**Impact**: LOW - Has other validation  

**Recommendation**: Implement more granular size limits based on user roles.

# Health Campaigns — Developer and Operator Guide

This document describes how the Health Campaigns feature works end‑to‑end after the recent stability and UX rework. It covers API design, required fields, image handling, frontend behavior, and production troubleshooting.

## Overview
- Public, read‑only for all authenticated users; create/edit restricted to staff roles (`ADMIN`, `STAFF`, `DOCTOR`, `NURSE`).
- Robust create/update with defensive file handling. Campaigns always save; image upload problems never cause HTTP 500.
- List API includes `description` and `content` so previews render without a second request.
- Frontend (admin + student): hydrates with detail GET for complete data; updates use PATCH to avoid overwriting unchanged fields.

## API Endpoints
Base: `/api/health-info/campaigns/`

- List: `GET /api/health-info/campaigns/?ordering=-created_at&page=<n>&page_size=<n>`
- Detail: `GET /api/health-info/campaigns/<id>/`
- Create: `POST /api/health-info/campaigns/` (multipart/form-data)
- Update (partial): `PATCH /api/health-info/campaigns/<id>/` (multipart/form-data or JSON)
- Delete: `DELETE /api/health-info/campaigns/<id>/`
- Engage: `POST /api/health-info/campaigns/<id>/engage/`
- Resources: `GET /api/health-info/campaigns/<id>/resources/`
- Upload resource: `POST /api/health-info/campaigns/<id>/upload_resource/`
- Analytics: `GET /api/health-info/campaigns/analytics/`
- Featured: `GET /api/health-info/campaigns/featured/`

## Data Model — Required Fields
Required to create:
- `title` (string)
- `description` (string)
- `campaign_type` (one of: GENERAL, VACCINATION, MENTAL_HEALTH, NUTRITION, DENTAL_HEALTH, HYGIENE, EXERCISE, SAFETY, PREVENTION, AWARENESS, EMERGENCY, SEASONAL, CUSTOM)
- `content` (string)
- `start_date` (ISO datetime or `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `end_date` (ISO datetime or `YYYY-MM-DD`, must be after `start_date`)

Optional but recommended:
- `summary`, `objectives`, `target_audience`, `call_to_action`, `priority`, `tags`, `external_link`, `contact_info`.

Images (optional):
- `banner_image` (image/*)
- `thumbnail_image` (image/*)
- `pubmat_image` (image/* or PDF)

## Image Handling (Cloudinary)
- Controlled in serializer: campaign is created/updated first, then images are attached only if Cloudinary is configured.
- If Cloudinary is not configured or the upload fails, the server logs a warning and returns success (campaign is saved without images).
- Production env vars (Heroku):
  - `USE_CLOUDINARY=True`
  - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

## Error Behavior
- Validation errors return HTTP 400 with field‑specific messages.
- File storage errors are logged but do not fail requests.
- Server never returns an HTML 500 page for expected validation/storage errors.

## Frontend Integration (React)
- Create/Update forms use FormData and do not force `Content-Type`; Axios sets multipart boundaries automatically.
- Quality gates (client‑side): minimum lengths for title/description/content and date sanity check; shows inline field errors.
- Updates use `PATCH` to avoid blanking fields not included in the payload.
- Admin edit/view/preview always fetch detail by id before rendering.
- Student list shows newest campaigns first, lazy‑loads images, provides overlay CTA, and supports “Load more” when paginated.

## Troubleshooting
- 500 on create with images:
  - Ensure the app is redeployed with the latest serializer and views.
  - Verify Cloudinary env vars; check `heroku logs --tail` for Cloudinary errors.
  - Even with Cloudinary down, campaign creation should succeed (images skipped).
- Content missing in preview:
  - The list now includes `description` and `content`. If still missing, hard refresh the SPA bundle and verify the API response payload.
- Edits wiping content:
  - The UI fetches detail before opening edit and uses PATCH. If this appears again, ensure the SPA bundle is updated (front‑end cache).

## Smoke Tests (Production)
1) Create campaign without images → Expect 201 and content visible on previews.
2) Create campaign with images → Expect images uploaded (when Cloudinary set) or created without images (no 500).
3) Edit an existing campaign → Fields prefilled; save without changing all fields → unchanged fields persist.
4) Student list → Newest first, images lazy‑load, dialog shows content; “Load more” present when applicable.

## Security Notes
- Rotate secrets if they were shared in logs or chat: `SECRET_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, and email credentials.
- Keep `DEBUG=False` in production.

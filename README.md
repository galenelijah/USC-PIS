## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### **Backend**
- **Framework**: Django 5.0.2 + Django REST Framework 3.14.0
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Production) / SQLite (Development)  
- **Authentication**: Token-based with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade headers (HSTS, CSP), rate limiting
- **Deployment**: Heroku with WhiteNoise for static files

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite build system
- **UI Library**: Material-UI design system  
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Yup validation schemas
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting (69% bundle reduction)

#### UX Components & Conventions (Sept 2025)
- `InfoTooltip` (components/utils/InfoTooltip.jsx): Lightweight help icon + tooltip used inline with titles and controls.
  - Usage: `<InfoTooltip title="Short helpful tip" placement="right" />`
- `PageHeader` `helpText` prop (components/utils/PageHeader.jsx): Adds a help icon next to the page title.
  - Usage: `<PageHeader title="Reports" helpText="How to generate and export" />`
- Form hints: `MyTextField`, `MySelector`, `MyDatePicker`, and `MyPassField` accept `hint` to show subtle guidance when no error is present.
  - Example: `<MyTextField name="phone" hint="7‚Äì15 digits, numbers only" />`
- Validation: Centralized in `utils/validationSchemas.js` via `commonValidation` (email, password, phone, idNumber, birthdate, numbers).
  - Forms use `yupResolver(schema)` so error messages are consistent across the app.

### **Infrastructure**  
- **Hosting**: Heroku with automatic deployments
- **Database**: Heroku Postgres with 15 custom indexes
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary-ready for persistent file storage
- **CI/CD**: GitHub integration with Heroku Pipelines

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/USC-PIS.git
cd USC-PIS

# Backend setup
cd backend
source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate     # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend setup (new terminal)
cd backend/frontend/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Production Deployment**
- **Live System**: [usc-pis.herokuapp.com](https://usc-pis.herokuapp.com)
- **Auto-Deploy**: Connected to GitHub for automatic builds
- **Database**: Heroku Postgres with enterprise security
- **Performance**: 90%+ optimized with intelligent caching

#### Campaigns ‚Äì Production Notes
- Image storage: Cloudinary is supported. Set env vars `USE_CLOUDINARY=True`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`.
- Validation: Create requires title, description, campaign_type, content, start_date, end_date (end after start). Errors return HTTP 400 with field messages.
- Reliability: Image upload failures are logged and do not block campaign creation.
- Admin edit/view: Always fetches detail before rendering; updates use PATCH to prevent unintended field overwrites.
- See full guide: `docs/CAMPAIGNS.md`.

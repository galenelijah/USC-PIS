### **üöÄ RECENT MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS**:
- **‚úÖ Enterprise Backup System**: Complete execution engine with performance optimization and smart restore
- **‚úÖ Data Recovery System**: Conflict detection, merge strategies (replace/merge/skip), and preview capabilities
- **‚úÖ Performance Optimization**: Quick backup option reduces completion time by 50%
- **‚úÖ Administrative Infrastructure**: All database monitor and backup management systems operational

### **‚úÖ STILL FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS**:
- ‚úÖ **Command-line Backups**: Management commands working

- ‚úÖ **USER AUTHENTICATION**: 7 active users, RBAC working
- ‚úÖ **BASIC PATIENT RECORDS**: Core medical workflow intact

### **üö® CORE HEALTHCARE GAPS** (After Emergency Fixes):
- ‚ùå **APPOINTMENT/SCHEDULING SYSTEM**: **COMPLETELY MISSING** - Dashboard shows "appointments today" but no appointment system exists
- ‚ùå **INVENTORY MANAGEMENT**: No medical supplies, medication, or equipment tracking
- ‚ùå **COMPREHENSIVE BILLING**: Only basic cost field in dental records, no financial management

**Impact**: **Emergency repairs must be completed before any new development.** Administrative oversight is completely compromised.

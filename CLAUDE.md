## System Architecture

### **Django Apps**
- `authentication/` - User management, RBAC
- `patients/` - Patient profiles, medical/dental records  
- `health_info/` - Health campaigns, information
- `medical_certificates/` - Certificate workflow
- `feedback/` - Patient feedback, analytics
- `reports/` - PDF/CSV/Excel export
- `notifications/` - In-app messaging
- `utils/` - System utilities, backup management, health monitoring

### **User Roles**
- **ADMIN/STAFF/DOCTOR**: Full administrative access
- **NURSE**: Medical record management
- **STUDENT**: Personal records only

### **Key Directories**
- **Config**: `backend/settings.py`, `backend/.env`
- **Models**: `patients/models.py`, `authentication/models.py`  
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/components/`, `frontend/src/utils/validationSchemas.js`
- **API**: `/api/auth/`, `/api/patients/`, `/api/medical-certificates/`, `/api/utils/`

## Development Setup

### **Backend**
```bash
cd USC-PIS/backend
source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver
```

### **Frontend**  
```bash
cd USC-PIS/backend/frontend/frontend
npm install && npm run dev
```

### **Database**: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)

## Backup & Recovery System Usage

### **Web Interface (Recommended)**
Access via: `/database-monitor` (Admin/Staff only)

**Creating Backups:**
1. Navigate to "Backup Management" tab
2. Click "Create Backup" button
3. Choose backup type:
   - **Database Only**: Patient records, users, campaigns (~0.5MB, 42-46s)
   - **Media Files Only**: Uploaded images, documents
   - **Complete System**: Database + media files (longer completion time)
4. Enable "Quick backup" for database backups to exclude logs/reports (50% faster)
5. Optionally enable "Verify backup integrity"
6. Click "Create Backup" - runs in background

**Downloading Backups:**
1. Go to "Backup History" tab
2. Find successful backup
3. Click "Download" button
4. File automatically downloads (JSON for database, ZIP for media/full)

**Restoring Backups:**
1. In "Backup History" tab, click "Restore" on database backup
2. Choose merge strategy:
   - **Replace**: Overwrite existing data (use for disaster recovery)
   - **Merge**: Update only empty fields (safer for partial restore)
   - **Skip**: Add new records only (safest option)
3. Click "Preview Restore" to see conflicts and impact
4. Review restore plan and click "Confirm Restore" if safe

### **Command Line Interface**
```bash
# Execute pending backups
./venv/Scripts/python.exe manage.py execute_backup --auto

# Execute specific backup by ID
./venv/Scripts/python.exe manage.py execute_backup --backup-id 123

# Create new backup record (via API trigger)
curl -X POST /api/utils/backup/trigger/ -d '{"backup_type": "database", "quick_backup": true}'
```

### **API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/utils/backup-health/` - System health and backup status
- `POST /api/utils/backup/trigger/` - Create new backup
- `GET /api/utils/backup/download/{id}/` - Download backup file
- `POST /api/utils/backup/restore/` - Restore backup with conflict resolution

## System Quality Assessment

**Grade: B+ (Technically Functional with Enterprise Infrastructure, Missing Core Healthcare Systems)**
- ‚úÖ Security: Enterprise-grade (HSTS, CSP, rate limiting, RBAC)
- ‚úÖ Performance: 90%+ optimization (caching, lazy loading, indexing)
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: **Enterprise-grade backup & recovery system with smart restore capabilities**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Features: Record management complete, **critical healthcare workflows missing**
- ‚ùå Healthcare Completeness: **Appointment system absent, limits clinical operations**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing: Minimal automated testing coverage

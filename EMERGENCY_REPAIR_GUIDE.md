## ✅ **Resolved Critical Issues**

### **1. Database Monitor Page - FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅**

**Root Cause**: Django model objects not properly serialized to JSON  
**Resolution**: Added comprehensive JSON serialization for all model objects  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All endpoints working with proper JSON responses  

**Technical Fix Applied**:
```python
# Fixed in utils/views.py - backup_health_check function
# Added proper serialization for all Django model objects
if health_summary['latest_database_backup']:
    health_summary['latest_database_backup'] = {
        'id': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].id,
        'backup_type': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].backup_type,
        'status': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].status,
        'started_at': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].started_at.isoformat(),
        'completed_at': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].completed_at.isoformat() if health_summary['latest_database_backup'].completed_at else None,
    }
```

### **2. Backup System Web Interface - FULLY ACCESSIBLE ✅**
**Issue**: API serialization errors preventing web interface access  
**Resolution**: Fixed all backup endpoints with proper JSON handling  
**Impact**: Complete backup management functionality restored  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Web interface fully operational  

### **3. Package Dependencies - RESOLVED ✅**
**Issue**: Missing cloudinary storage packages causing import errors

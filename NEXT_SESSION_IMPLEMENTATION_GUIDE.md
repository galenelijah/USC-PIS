   class AppointmentType(models.Model):  # Consultation, checkup, etc.
   ```

3. **Database Schema Planning**

   - Provider selection
   - Date/time picker
   - Appointment type selection
   - Booking confirmation

2. **Staff Management Interface**
   - Provider calendar view
   - Appointment scheduling for patients
   - Appointment status management

3. **Dashboard Integration**

#### **Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Days 4-5)**
1. **Email Integration**
   - Appointment confirmation emails
   - Reminder system
   - Cancellation notifications

2. **Calendar Features**
   - Weekly/monthly calendar view

1. **Database Models** - Provider, Appointment, TimeSlot models created and migrated
2. **Basic API** - Create appointment, list appointments, check availability endpoints working
3. **Simple Frontend** - Basic appointment booking form functional
4. **Dashboard Fix** - "Appointments today" showing real data instead of mock data

### **Complete Implementation Goals**
1. **Full Booking System** - Patients can book appointments through web interface
2. **Staff Management** - Staff can manage appointments, view provider calendars
3. **Email Integration** - Appointment confirmations and reminders working
4. **Calendar Views** - Professional calendar interface for appointment management

### **Integration Success**
1. **Dashboard Integration** - Appointment data properly displayed on main dashboard
2. **User Experience** - Seamless integration with existing USC-PIS workflows
3. **Performance** - Fast appointment searches and booking operations

## 🔮 **Long-term Roadmap After Appointments**

After appointment system completion, the priority order becomes:
1. **Testing Coverage** - Comprehensive testing for appointment and backup systems
2. **Inventory Management** - Medical supplies and medication tracking
3. **Billing & Financial Management** - Patient billing and payment processing
4. **Enhanced Features** - Role-based ID system, in-app notifications, feedback automation

---

**🎯 BOTTOM LINE**: The backup system is **complete and deployment-ready**. The next session should focus entirely on **appointment/scheduling system development** as this is the most critical remaining healthcare workflow gap that prevents real-world clinical operations.

**Confidence Level**: Backup system 100% complete and tested  
**Next Session Focus**: Appointment system from scratch (highest business priority)  
**Estimated Timeline**: 4-5 days for functional appointment booking system  
**Risk Assessment**: Low - backup system provides foundation, appointment system is additive

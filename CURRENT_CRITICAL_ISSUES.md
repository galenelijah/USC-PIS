- **Current Status**: All three database monitor tabs fully functional
- **User Impact**: Complete access to system health monitoring and backup management restored

**Technical Fix Applied**:
```python
# Fixed in utils/views.py - backup_health_check function
# Added proper serialization for Django model objects:
if health_summary['latest_database_backup']:
    health_summary['latest_database_backup'] = {
        'id': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].id,
        'backup_type': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].backup_type,
        'status': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].status,
        'started_at': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].started_at.isoformat(),
        'completed_at': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].completed_at.isoformat() if health_summary['latest_database_backup'].completed_at else None,
    }
```

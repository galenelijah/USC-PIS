if health_summary['latest_database_backup']:
    health_summary['latest_database_backup'] = {
        'id': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].id,
        'backup_type': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].backup_type,
        'status': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].status,
        'started_at': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].started_at.isoformat(),

# USC-PIS Critical Issues Report

**Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **ALL CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**  
**Priority**: **NORMAL - SYSTEM OPERATIONAL**

## âœ… **RESOLVED CRITICAL ISSUES**

### **1. Database Monitor Page - FIXED âœ…**
**Resolution**: Fixed JSON serialization in backup-health API endpoint
- **Previous Issue**: Database monitor page returned HTML 500 error instead of JSON data
- **Root Cause Identified**: Django model objects not properly serialized to JSON in backup_health_check view
- **Fix Applied**: Added proper JSON serialization for all BackupStatus model objects
- **Current Status**: All three database monitor tabs fully functional
- **User Impact**: Complete access to system health monitoring and backup management restored

**Technical Fix Applied**:
```python
# Fixed in utils/views.py - backup_health_check function
# Added proper serialization for Django model objects:
if health_summary['latest_database_backup']:
    health_summary['latest_database_backup'] = {
        'id': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].id,
        'backup_type': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].backup_type,
        'status': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].status,
        'started_at': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].started_at.isoformat(),
        'completed_at': health_summary['latest_database_backup'].completed_at.isoformat() if health_summary['latest_database_backup'].completed_at else None,
    }
```

## Table Schema Analysis

### **Core Tables Structure**

#### `authentication_user` (45+ columns)
**Purpose**: Extended Django user model with comprehensive profile data

**Key Fields**:
- Basic: id, username, email, password, first_name, last_name
- Profile: middle_name, sex, birthday, phone, course, year_level, school
- Address: address_permanent, address_present
- Medical: weight, height, bmi, blood_type, allergies, medical_history
- Emergency: emergency_contact_name, emergency_contact_phone, emergency_contact_relationship
- System: role, completeSetup, is_active, date_joined

**Issues Identified**:
- **Over-normalized**: 45+ columns in single table
- **Mixed concerns**: Authentication + Profile + Medical data
- **Data quality**: 23.5% non-USC emails

#### `patients_patient` (12+ columns)
**Purpose**: Patient records linked to users

**Key Fields**:
- Basic: first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, gender
- Contact: email, phone_number, address
- System: user_id (FK), created_by_id (FK), created_at, updated_at

**Relationship**: OneToOne with authentication_user

#### `patients_medicalrecord` (11+ columns)
**Purpose**: Medical visit records

**Key Fields**:
- Visit: visit_date, diagnosis, treatment, notes
- Classification: record_type, physical_examination, vital_signs
- System: patient_id (FK), created_by_id (FK), created_at, updated_at

**Current Usage**: 3 records for 9 patients (33% coverage)

#### `patients_dentalrecord` (27+ columns)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive dental examination records

**Key Fields**:
- Visit: visit_date, procedure_performed, tooth_numbers (FDI notation)
- Clinical: diagnosis, treatment_performed, treatment_plan
- Examination: oral_hygiene_status, gum_condition, tooth_chart (JSON)
- Pain: pain_level (1-10 scale), clinical_notes
- Treatment: anesthesia_used, anesthesia_type, materials_used
- Follow-up: next_appointment_recommended, home_care_instructions
- Business: priority, cost, insurance_covered
- Files: xray_images, photos, documents (JSON arrays)

**Current Usage**: 1 record (significant underutilization)

## Data Quality Assessment

### **Email Compliance Analysis**
```sql
USC Emails (@usc.edu.ph): 13 users (76.5%) ✅
Non-USC Emails: 4 users (23.5%) ⚠️

Non-USC Email Breakdown:
- Legacy users from development phase
- May include test accounts
- Violates USC-only policy from thesis
```

### **Profile Completion Analysis**
```sql
Complete Profiles: 13 users (76.5%)
Incomplete Profiles: 4 users (23.5%)

Common Missing Data:
- Phone numbers
- Address information
- Medical history details
- Emergency contacts
```

### **Medical Data Coverage**
```sql
Patients with Medical Records: 3/9 (33%)
Patients with Dental Records: 1/9 (11%)
Patients with No Records: 6/9 (67%)

Insight: Low utilization despite comprehensive system
```

## Performance Analysis

### **Query Performance Indicators**

#### **Potential N+1 Query Issues**
Identified in patient views where related medical/dental records aren't prefetched:
```python
# Current (inefficient)
patients = Patient.objects.all()
for patient in patients:
    patient.medical_records.all()  # N+1 query

# Optimized
patients = Patient.objects.prefetch_related('medical_records', 'dental_records')
```

#### **Missing Database Indexes**
Critical indexes needed for frequent queries:
```sql
-- User lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email_role ON authentication_user(email, role);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_created_at ON authentication_user(date_joined);

-- Patient lookups  
CREATE INDEX idx_patient_email ON patients_patient(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_patient_created ON patients_patient(created_at);

-- Medical record queries
CREATE INDEX idx_medical_patient_date ON patients_medicalrecord(patient_id, visit_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_dental_patient_date ON patients_dentalrecord(patient_id, visit_date);
```

#### **Table Size Analysis**
Current tables are small but schema is extensive:
- Large number of columns with minimal data
- JSON fields (tooth_chart, xray_images) designed for scalability
- Well-designed for growth but currently underutilized

## Security Analysis

### **Data Protection Assessment**

#### **Strengths**
- Proper foreign key relationships with CASCADE/SET_NULL
- Audit trails with created_at/updated_at timestamps
- User role-based access control implemented
- No sensitive data in plain text (passwords hashed)

#### **Concerns**
- Production database URL exposed in .env file
- No data encryption at rest (field-level)
- Missing data retention policies
- No audit logging for data access

### **HIPAA Compliance Considerations**
As a healthcare system, consider:
- Patient data encryption requirements
- Access logging and audit trails
- Data retention and purging policies
- Backup security and encryption

## Data Integrity Analysis

### **Relationship Integrity**
```sql
Users vs Patients: 17 users, 9 patients
└── Gap: Not all users have patient records

Patient Records:
├── Medical: 3 patients have medical records
├── Dental: 1 patient has dental records  
└── Orphaned: 0 (good integrity)

System Tables:
├── Migrations: Properly tracked
├── Sessions: Active session management
└── Permissions: Role-based access intact
```

### **Data Consistency Issues**
1. **User-Patient Mapping**: 17 users but only 9 patients (expected for admin users)
2. **Email Duplication**: Need to verify no duplicate emails across tables
3. **Date Validation**: All dates appear within reasonable ranges
4. **Required Fields**: Most required fields populated

## Optimization Recommendations

### **Immediate (Week 1)**
1. **Add Critical Indexes**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_email ON authentication_user(email);
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_patient_user ON patients_patient(user_id);
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_medical_patient ON patients_medicalrecord(patient_id);
   ```

2. **Query Optimization**:
   ```python
   # Optimize dashboard queries
   Patient.objects.select_related('user').prefetch_related(
       'medical_records', 'dental_records'
   )
   ```

### **Short-term (Weeks 2-4)**
1. **Database Normalization**:
   - Split authentication_user into User + UserProfile + MedicalInfo
   - Create separate EmergencyContact model
   - Normalize address data

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Enable pg_stat_statements for query analysis
   - Add connection pooling
   - Implement query logging for slow queries

### **Medium-term (Weeks 4-8)**
1. **Data Architecture**:
   - Implement soft deletes for audit trails
   - Add data archiving strategy
   - Create read replicas for reporting

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Access logging implementation
   - Data retention policy automation

## Usage Insights

### **System Adoption Challenges**
Despite comprehensive feature set:
- **Low medical record usage**: 3 records for 9 patients
- **Minimal dental utilization**: 1 record despite 27-field system
- **No file uploads**: 0 files despite upload system
- **Limited feedback**: 2 entries only

### **Recommendations for Adoption**
1. **Training**: Staff training on comprehensive dental system
2. **Workflows**: Integration with clinic daily operations
3. **Incentives**: Benefits demonstration for record-keeping
4. **Support**: User support during transition period

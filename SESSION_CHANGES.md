# Session Changes (2025-08-23)

This document lists all changes made in this session, with file paths and brief notes.

## New Files
- `AGENTS.md`
  - Contributor guide tailored to this repo (structure, commands, style, testing, PRs, security tips).
- `OPEN_ISSUES.md`
  - Tracking doc for 11 user-reported issues with observations and implementation notes.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/Patients/PatientsPage.jsx`
  - New Patients page wrapper with a debounced search box calling `patientService.search`; shows result count and renders `PatientList`.
- `docs/session-notes/2025-08-23-session-log.md`
  - Dated session log with summary, changes, issues, decisions, next actions, references.
- `scripts/new-session-log.sh`
  - Helper script to create a dated session log file under `docs/session-notes/`.

## Modified Files
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/Register.jsx`
  - Added `setError` (react-hook-form) and mapped backend errors to inline fields: `email`, `password`, `password2`; handles `non_field_errors`/`detail`.
  - Keeps top-level error alert for non-field/server errors.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/static/choices.jsx`
  - Added `CampusChoices` (Downtown/Talamban); removed South Campus per requirements. IDs equal labels for readable stored values.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/ProfileSetup.jsx`
  - Switched `year_level` and `school` from `MyTextField` to `MySelector`.
  - `year_level`: options from `YearLevelChoices` (required).
  - `school`: options from `CampusChoices`.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/App.jsx`
  - Replaced patients route component from `PatientList` to `PatientsPage`.
  - Passes `initialPatients` prop sourced from existing App state.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/PatientMedicalDashboard.jsx`
  - Normalizes sex using `getSexLabel(sex)` before BMI image selection (works for numeric or string-coded values).
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/HealthRecords.jsx`
  - After save (create/update), refreshes list via `fetchHealthRecords()` for authoritative state.
  - Added tooltip explaining when “Generate Certificate” suggestions appear; added helper text below Record Type select.
  - Minor imports updated to include `Tooltip` and `InfoOutlinedIcon`.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/CampaignsPage.jsx`
  - Renders campaign content using `ContentViewer` (both View and Public Preview) for better formatting/safety.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/Reports.jsx`
  - Detects HTML/JSON error payloads on download and surfaces readable error text instead of downloading garbage.
- `AGENTS.md`
  - Added “Session Logs (Recommended)” section with usage of `scripts/new-session-log.sh` and references to `SESSION_CHANGES.md`.
- `README.md`
  - Added link to `docs/session-notes/` under Documentation.

## Verify Quickly
- Registration: trigger a backend validation error and see inline messages under inputs.
- Profile Setup: Year Level and School/Campus render as dropdowns.
- Patients: `/patients` shows search input; typing (≥2 chars) filters results.
- Patient Dashboard: BMI image matches user sex whether stored as id or string.

## Additional Updates (2025-08-23)
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/HealthRecords.jsx`
  - Refresh records from server after create/update (`fetchHealthRecords()`), add tooltip clarifying when “Generate Certificate” appears, and helper text for Record Type.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/CampaignsPage.jsx`
  - Render campaign `content` via `ContentViewer` (View dialog and Public Preview) to preserve formatting.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/Reports.jsx`
  - Detect and surface HTML/JSON error payloads on download instead of forcing a file download.
- `backend/frontend/frontend/src/components/static/choices.jsx`
  - Remove “South Campus”; restrict `CampusChoices` to Downtown/Talamban.

## Verification (2025-08-23)
- Reports download endpoint
  - Backend path verified: `backend/reports/urls.py` registers `generated` viewset; `GeneratedReportViewSet.download` serves files with correct `Content-Type`, `Content-Disposition`, and `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` (see `backend/reports/views.py`).
  - Frontend uses `responseType: 'blob'`; UI now surfaces server-side errors if HTML/JSON is returned.
  - Manual check (when running): generate a report via `POST /api/reports/templates/{id}/generate/`, poll `/api/reports/generated/{id}/status/` until `COMPLETED`, then GET `/api/reports/generated/{id}/download/` and confirm headers and non-empty payload.
- Database/Backup monitor endpoints
  - Backend paths verified in `backend/utils/urls.py`: `/api/utils/database-health/` and `/api/utils/backup/health/` map to JSON-producing views with `IsAuthenticated` + role checks in `backend/utils/views.py`.
  - Frontend routes and service calls match these endpoints; legacy fallback `/api/utils/backup-health/` also exists.
- Student dashboard routing
  - Code shows distinct STUDENT quick actions in `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` (links to `/health-records`, `/health-info`, `/campaigns`). If duplicates appear, likely a stale build/environment mismatch.
